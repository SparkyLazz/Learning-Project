### Upcoming Projects
As I progress through levels, I will add medium and large projects to this repository, showcasing more advanced programming concepts.

## How It Works
Each project is:
1. Designed to improve specific skills.
2. Terminal-based for simplicity and focus on logic.
3. Gamified by tracking levels and progress.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/learning-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the code (language-specific instructions will be provided in each project folder).

## Contact
